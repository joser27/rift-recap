    "summary": "Currently a mysterious summoner with untapped potential, waiting to burst onto the Rift with their unique playstyle. As a 'FILL' player, you're showing flexibility but haven't yet carved out your competitive identity.",
    "strength": "Versatility in role selection, demonstrated by choosing 'FILL' - showing adaptability and team-first mentality that many high-level players would respect.",
    "weakness": "Limited match history and statistical data suggest a need to focus on consistent gameplay. Recommend playing 10-15 ranked matches in a specific role to establish a more defined champion pool and improve mechanical skills.",
    "funFact": "With zero first bloods and zero penta kills, you're essentially a League of Legends tabula rasa - all potential, zero pressure! Your journey is just beginning, and that's exciting.",
    "personalAdvice": "Time to turn that blank canvas into a masterpiece of League domination! Pick 2-3 champions you genuinely enjoy, learn their mechanics inside and out, and start building your legend."
